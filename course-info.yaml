summary: 'What’s better than getting a cup of coffee during a break? Getting a cup
  of coffee that you don’t have to make yourself, of course. All you need to do is
  press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy. But before
  you can enjoy your caffeinated beverage, you need to teach the machine how to make
  it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The
  machine works with common products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups. If it
  runs out of something, it displays a notification. The machine makes three types
  of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing in life is free, it
  also collects your money.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/67</a>'
